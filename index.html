    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p> I decide to take the Intro to Programming because learning how to code has intrigued me.  I wanted to learn something new and try to get a better understanding of a language I interact with everyday.  I thought taking the Intro to Programming class would be a fun and educational tool to learn with my sister.</p>
