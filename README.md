## Git,HTML and CSS

### Portfolio Project

This project was to demonstrate our knowledge on creating a webpage from nothing using HTML and CSS.
We used everything we learned in these past three weeks of class.

## Setup Instructions
To run this project, install bootstrap on your computer.  Then open up your Terminal and create a directory on your desktop.  Do that by typing in cd Desktop and then Cd mkdir and what you want to call your directory.  
Then make sure you are in that current directory that you want to clone my repo in. Initialize git by typing $git init. 
Once you do that you can clone my repository by going to this link https://github.com/chelso3388/Portfolio-project.git  
Do that by clicking the clone or download button on Github.  
Type git clone, and paste the URL and press enter.  
After you can see my HTML code for my portfolio and my css folder.
