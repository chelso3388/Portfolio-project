##Git,HTML and CSS

###Portfolio Project


This project was to demonstrate our knowledge on creating a webpage from nothing using HTML and CSS.
We used everything we learned in these past three weeks of class.

##Setup Instructions
Download bootstrap on your computer and after that you can just clone my repository onto your computer.  
Do that by clicking the clone or download button on Github.  
Open terminal and change the current working directory to the location where you want to clone it.  
Type git clone, and paste the URL and press enter.
